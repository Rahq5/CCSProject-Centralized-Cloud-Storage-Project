# 1.0 Documentation (not completed yet...)
## 1.1 Introduction
- **Project Name :** CCSP or Centralized Cloud Storage Project
  
- **Description**: A Centralized cloud storage application that allows users to upload, download, and manage their files. initially hosting will be locally without using any server-less technologies like AWS , Azure and Google, instead will be hosted on a raspberry Pi device with NAS disks.

## 1.2 Project Goals
A list below shows what am personally trying to achieve while building this project:
- access the CCSP from internet (wide open and not locally with home modem)
- Upload and download files from different media types:
	- initially:
		- files from type: `.txt | .pdf | .png | .jpeg` 
	- Future + including initially types:
		 - file from type: `.docx | .zip`
		 - files from (has limitations): `.mp4 | .mp3`

## 1.3 Core Features
### 1.3.1 Functional Requirements:
- (FR-01) Upload Files
- (FR-02) Download Files
- (FR-03) Deletion Files
- (FR-04) Share drive ==(to be discussed later)==
- (FR-05) view list of uploaded folders and files on the cloud web page
- (FR-06) view files storage capacity
- (FR-07) The system shall provide a user registration and login page  
### 1.3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- (NFR-01) The system shall use a method of security ==(to be discussed later)==
  
  discuss what to add more here....

## 1.4 Future Features
### 1.4.1 Functional Requirements:
- (FR-01) **Dedicated Server**: The system shall be hosted on raspberry pi 5.
- (FR-02) **Containerization**: The system shall use Docker for deployment and updates

need to be disscussed for more things
### 1.4.2 Non-Functional Requirements:
- (NFR- 0) **Enhanced Storage**: The system shall have at least 1TB.
